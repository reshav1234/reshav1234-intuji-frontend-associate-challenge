## Features

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a modern web browser to run the dashboard.

### Steps
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `dashboard.html` file in a browser.
3. The dashboard will load automatically with weekly data displayed by default.

## File Structure
```
